## The Startup Story: Why Shop2Woo Was Built

It started with a problem—one that too many Shopify sellers face:

> “I want to switch to WooCommerce, but I can’t figure out how to migrate my store.”

That’s what sparked the idea behind Shop2Woo.

The founder, a freelance WordPress developer and ex-dropshipper, was managing client requests for Shopify-to-WooCommerce transitions. Time and time again, store owners ran into the same hurdles:

* Shopify doesn’t make it easy to export everything.
* API access can be complex and limited.
* Most migration tools were **too technical or too expensive.**
* Some even required **full developer access**—a no-go for many solo entrepreneurs.

So he built a lightweight solution for one of his clients: a simple import/export tool using the Shopify store’s **public product JSON** and WooCommerce’s native product schema.

The result?

A **fully functional WooCommerce store** with all the products, images, prices, and variants **intact**—without ever needing to log into Shopify or request API credentials.

That custom tool quickly evolved into what is now known as **Shop2Woo**.

* ✅ **Secure** – No Shopify login or API key needed

## Case Study: Tobi's Digital Store Journey

Let’s talk about **Tobi**, a digital product creator based in Nigeria. He started selling digital templates and ebooks via Shopify in 2021. Things went well at first—but as sales grew, so did the limitations:

* Monthly bills: Shopify plan + 4 paid apps = \$127/month
* App conflicts: Digital Downloads didn’t always deliver properly
* Checkout customization: Impossible without custom code

Tobi started researching how to move to WooCommerce. Most solutions he found required:

* API credentials
* Developers
* High fees

Then he stumbled on **Shop2Woo** via a WordPress forum.

> “I was skeptical at first,” he said, “but the plugin literally saved me weeks of work. I exported my Shopify products as a JSON file, uploaded them to WordPress with Shop2Woo, and that was it. No API, no stress, no dev help needed.”

Tobi has now built a fast, low-cost WooCommerce store with full digital delivery automation using **Easy Digital Downloads**—and recommends Shop2Woo to his community.
